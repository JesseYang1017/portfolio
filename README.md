- [NIST Project (Github link)](https://github.com/widVE/NIST.git)

    This project addresses the complex challenges of indoor navigation and collaboration, particularly to support first responders in emergency situations. My contribution involved     implementing a 3D volumetric map in Unity to improve situational awareness and enable the commander to better visualize and direct the teams.

    In this setup, two teams operate inside a hazardous area, such as a burning building, while a remote commander oversees their operations. Each team member and the commander use HoloLens headsets for real-time data sharing and communication. Specifically, the search team, equipped with HoloLens 2 headsets, scans the environment, sending structural model data to the server and placing markers on critical features, like biohazard zones or victim locations.

    The server manages an array of data, including maps, features, headset details, and navigation paths. With this setup, the commander spawn the volumetric map on a flat surface, like a 
table. This map can be clipped within an adjustable volume, allowing the commander to view only selected portions, or manipulated freely by zooming and rotating. Real-time updates, such 
as feature markers and the animated avatars of responders within the building, are streamed via a WebSocket connection.

    To direct responders efficiently, the commander can drag an avatar to a designated marker—such as a victim's location—prompting Unity's NavMesh to generate a navigation path. This path 
displays both on the server and to the specific responder. By following the path, the responder can accurately reach the designated point, ensuring prompt and coordinated actions during 
the mission.
